# Improvement Roadmap

v1.4.0 ships a 119-tool MCP surface with Hyperframes integration, repurposing workflows, and expanded preflight guardrails. Remotion has been fully removed; the current priority is safer agentic media automation.

---

## 📋 Planned for v1.3.0

### Revideo Integration — RESEARCHED, DEFERRED

Revideo (MIT licensed, canvas-based) was evaluated as a Remotion replacement. However, Revideo lacks a standalone CLI for external project rendering — it requires running `npm run render` inside the project directory via a TypeScript `render.ts` script. This architecture does not map cleanly to the engine → server → client → CLI pattern used by Hyperframes and Remotion.

**Decision:** Defer Revideo integration. Hyperframes (HTML-native, Apache 2.0) covers the code-to-video use case well. If demand emerges, reconsider.

### Remotion Removal Timeline

- **v1.2.x:** Remotion tools emitted `DeprecationWarning`
- **v1.3.0:** Remotion tools emitted `FutureWarning`
- **post-v1.3.0:** Remotion integration removed entirely (breaking change) — ✅ completed

---

## ✅ Completed in v1.2.0 (2026-03-31)

### Security Hardening (56 tasks)
- [x] Centralized validation module (`validation.py`) with parameter validators and allowed-value constants
- [x] Shared FFmpeg helpers (`ffmpeg_helpers.py`) — deduplicated `_escape_ffmpeg_filter_value`, `_validate_input_path`, `_run_ffmpeg`
- [x] FFmpeg filter injection prevention — all numeric params sanitized before interpolation via `_sanitize_ffmpeg_number`
- [x] Color validation hardened — whitelist CSS named colors + hex + `0xRRGGBB` format, reject FFmpeg special chars
- [x] Null byte rejection on all input paths across all engines
- [x] Server-side parameter validation across the public MCP surface (crf, preset, format, transitions, audio, AI)
- [x] Preflight guardrails for risky video/audio operations: filter bounds, merge compatibility, audio mixing, overlay/watermark/chroma parameters, animated text timing/overflow, and grid/split-screen mismatches
- [x] `except Exception` fallback on all ~55 tool functions — no raw exceptions leak to MCP framework
- [x] Timeout (600s) on all 22 subprocess.run calls in ai_engine.py
- [x] Subprocess.TimeoutExpired handling in ai_engine.py
- [x] Fixed B904 ruff lint errors (25 `raise from None` additions)

### Engine Bug Fixes
- [x] Fixed `_run_ffmpeg_with_progress` deadlock (stdout PIPE → DEVNULL)
- [x] Fixed `convert()` hardcoded `/dev/null` → `os.devnull`
- [x] Fixed `resize()` division by zero on zero-dimension videos
- [x] Fixed `_build_pitch_shift_filter()` atempo chaining for extreme semitone values
- [x] Fixed `generate_subtitles()` — validates entries have required keys
- [x] Fixed `write_metadata()` — removed overly restrictive `=` check on values
- [x] Fixed `extract_audio()` — format whitelist validation
- [x] Fixed `_auto_output()` — prevents overwriting input file
- [x] Fixed `audio_waveform()` — removed broken ffprobe fallback
- [x] Fixed `speed()` — caps atempo chain count at 20
- [x] Fixed `_validate_position()` — proper MCPVideoError instead of InputFileError
- [x] Fixed `edit_timeline()` — removed duplicate image overlay processing
- [x] Fixed `_escape_ffmpeg_filter_value` — backslash handling, added semicolon escaping
- [x] Fixed storyboard() — removed unused tmpdir

### AI Engine Fixes
- [x] Null-byte rejection on all 7 public functions
- [x] Timeout on all subprocess.run calls
- [x] Fixed `_match_reference_colors()` — narrowed except clause

- [x] Total: 832 tests (707 fast, 116 slow/hyperframes)

---

## ✅ Completed in v1.1.5 (2026-03-31)

### CLI Improvements
- [x] `extract-frame` CLI command with `--time` flag
- [x] `edit` command supports inline JSON (no need for separate file)
- [x] `export-frames` renamed `--format` to `--image-format` to avoid shadowing global `--format`
- [x] All effect-* commands auto-generate output when `--output` omitted
- [x] Structured JSON error output on invalid JSON arguments (`--format json`)

### Server Validation
- [x] Parameter validation on 12 MCP tools (intensity ranges, font sizes, fps bounds, etc.)

## High Impact (Directly improves every user session)

- [x] **Progress callbacks** — Long operations (merge, convert, export) give no feedback. A progress percentage in the MCP response would let agents tell users "50% done..." instead of silence. FFmpeg outputs progress to stderr — parse it.
- [x] **Output file cleanup** — `video_cleanup` MCP tool removes intermediate files, with a `keep` list to preserve finals.
- [ ] **Smarter GIF output** — 3-second GIF at "low" quality = 28MB. The two-pass palette approach is good but `scale=480:-1` is too large for "low". Scale by quality preset: low=320, medium=480, high=640.
- [x] **Visual verification** — After an operation, return a thumbnail of the first frame of the output. *(Shipped in v1.0.0)*

## Medium Impact (Makes the API less frustrating)

- [x] **Video effects/filters** — Blur, sharpen, color grading, color presets (warm/cool/vintage/cinematic/noir), grayscale, sepia, invert, vignette. *(Shipped in v0.3.0 as `video_filter` with `filter_type` presets)*
- [x] **Audio editing** — Audio normalization to LUFS targets (YouTube -16, broadcast -23, Spotify -14). *(Shipped in v0.3.0 as `video_normalize_audio`)*
- [x] **Reverse playback** — Reverse video and audio so it plays backwards. *(Shipped in v0.4.0)*
- [x] **Green screen / chroma key** — Remove solid color backgrounds using `chromakey` filter. *(Shipped in v0.4.0)*
- [x] **Denoise & deinterlace filters** — New filter types in `video_filter`: `denoise` (hqdn3d) and `deinterlace` (yadif). *(Shipped in v0.4.0)*
- [x] **Smarter GIF output** — Quality-based scaling (low=320, medium=480, high=640, ultra=800) instead of fixed 480px. *(Shipped in v0.4.0)*
- [x] **Rich CLI output** — Human-friendly terminal UI with tables, spinners, styled error panels. `--format json` for scripts. `--version` flag. Video templates (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reel, YouTube, Instagram Post). *(Shipped in v0.4.0)*

- [x] **Crop by percentage** — `video_crop` supports `crop_percent` (e.g. 50 for center 50%).
- [x] **Orientation-aware metadata** — `video_info` returns `rotation`, `display_width`, `display_height`, `display_resolution`, and `aspect_ratio`.
- [x] **Merge auto-concat** — `video_merge` auto-normalizes resolution, codec, fps, and audio sample rate mismatches.
- [x] **convert vs export clarity** — Docstrings updated: `video_convert` for format/codec changes, `video_export` for final delivery re-encoding.
- [x] **Template preview** — `video_template_preview` returns operations list, estimated duration, resolution, and size without rendering.
- [x] **Batch operations** — Accept multiple inputs for a single operation. "Trim these 5 videos to 10 seconds each" in one call instead of 5. *(Shipped in v0.3.0 as `video_batch`)*

## Low Impact (Nice to have)

- [x] **Custom font upload** — `font_manager.py` downloads and caches Google Fonts by name for use in text overlays. *(Shipped in v1.3.0)*
- [ ] **Video concatenation with transitions per-clip** — Already supported in `merge` via `transitions` parameter, but add a `video_edit` shortcut for simple "clip A -> fade -> clip B -> dissolve -> clip C" patterns.
- [ ] **Audio waveform extraction** — Return a text-based waveform representation so agents can "see" the audio without playing it. Useful for finding silence or loud sections.
- [x] **Subtitle generation from text** — Given a list of `[(start, end, text)]` tuples, generate an SRT file and burn it in one step. *(Shipped as `video_generate_subtitles`)*
- [ ] **Frame-accurate seeking** — Use `-ss` before `-i` (input seeking) for speed, but fall back to output seeking for frame accuracy when the user specifies exact timestamps.
- [x] **Output directory option** — Currently outputs go next to the input file. Add a global `output_dir` option so all intermediates go to a temp folder. *(Shipped in v0.3.0 as `video_batch --output-dir` / `output_dir` param)*

## Observability (For you as the maintainer)

- [~] **Usage analytics** — Dropped 2026-06-12. A v1.3.0 agent commit shipped a ping module pointing at a Vercel endpoint that was never deployed or owned; removed because an unowned, claimable domain receiving install IDs is a liability, not observability. If telemetry ever returns it needs an endpoint we actually control, decided first.
- [ ] **Structured logging** — Currently silent on success. Add a `--verbose` flag and optional log file. Helps users debug their own issues before filing them.
- [x] **GitHub Actions CI** — Run the full test suite on push. Catch regressions before they ship. Currently manual. *(Shipped in v0.2.x)*

## Not Doing (Intentionally out of scope)

- **Streaming** — RTMP, HLS output. Different domain.
- **GPU acceleration** — Keep it simple. CPU FFmpeg is fast enough for the target use case.

## FFmpeg Coverage Gaps

Features that FFmpeg supports but mcp-video doesn't expose yet. Ordered by impact.

### High Impact
- [x] **Audio effects** — Reverb (`aecho`), equalizer (`equalizer`), compressor (`acompressor`), pitch shift (`asetrate`+`aresample`), noise reduction (`afftdn`)
- [x] **Video stabilization** — Deshake filter (`vidstab`) for shaky handheld footage (requires FFmpeg with vidstab)
- [x] **Scene detection** — Auto-detect scene changes using `select` filter, return timestamps
- [x] **Quality metrics** — PSNR, SSIM, VMAF calculation for comparing video quality

### Medium Impact
- [x] **HLS/DASH streaming** — `hls_segment()` segments video into HTTP Live Streaming format with multi-quality variants. *(Shipped in v1.3.0)*
- [x] **Advanced codecs** — `convert()` now supports `hevc` (H.265), `av1`, and `prores` output formats. *(Shipped in v1.3.0)*
- [x] **Image sequences** — Create video from image sequences (`img2pipe`), export frames
- [x] **Metadata editing** — Read/write video metadata tags, chapter support
- [x] **Audio waveform extraction** — Text-based waveform for silence/loud section detection
- [x] **Subtitle generation** — Generate SRT from `[(start, end, text)]` tuples, burn in one step *(Shipped as `video_generate_subtitles`)*

### Low Impact
- [x] **Ken Burns / zoom pan** — Animated zoom/pan effects via `zoompan` filter
- [x] **Advanced masking** — New `luma_key()` (brightness-based masking) and `shape_mask()` (circle, rounded_rect, oval) tools. *(Shipped in v1.3.0)*
- [ ] **Frame-accurate seeking** — Input seeking for speed, output seeking for accuracy
- [x] **Two-pass encoding** — More efficient compression for target file sizes
