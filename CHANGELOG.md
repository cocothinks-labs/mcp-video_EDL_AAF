# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes should be recorded here.

This project follows a simple release-note style:

- `Added` for new capabilities.
- `Changed` for behavior changes.
- `Fixed` for bug fixes.
- `Security` for vulnerability fixes.

## Unreleased

## 1.3.8 - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Fixed AI scene-detection JSON output so perceptual-hash differences are serialized as standard JSON numbers.
- Added `torchcodec` to stem-separation extras and diagnostics so Demucs output works with current TorchAudio save behavior.

## 1.3.7 - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Fixed `search_tools()` / `Client.search_tools()` so discovery includes the full 91-tool MCP surface, including PUSHING CREATION, Hyperframes, audio, and AI tools.

## 1.3.6 - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Added PUSHING CREATION-compatible cinematic pre-production tools:
  - `video_project_create`
  - `style_pack_read`
  - `storyboard_read`
  - `shot_prompt_render`

### Changed

- Updated package, MCP registry metadata, README, `llms.txt`, and tool docs for the 91-tool cinematic creation surface.
- Toned down public launch copy so test coverage is supporting evidence rather than the main product message.

### Fixed

- Restored README readiness anchors required by the repository audit.

## 1.3.1 - 2026-05-03

### Security

- Fixed command injection risk in `engine_stabilize.py` — vectors file path now validated as absolute.
- Enabled SSL certificate verification for AI model downloads in `ai_engine/upscale.py`.
- Redacted full filesystem paths from stabilization error messages.

### Fixed

- Added proper AI operation timeout (3600s) for demucs/whisper — prevents premature kills on long videos.
- Increased FFmpeg stderr buffer from 1MB to 10MB — fixes truncated progress for long-running operations.
- Fixed temp file leak in typewriter text effect — cleanup now happens even on write failure.
- Added `OSError` handling in hyperframes for file size race conditions.
- Added pitch shift semitones range validation (-48 to +48) — prevents FFmpeg filter chain overflow.
- Capped pixel count in color extraction (50K max) — prevents memory exhaustion on large images.
- Added try-finally cleanup for Whisper temp WAV files.
- Added bitrate/size range validation in probe before integer conversion.
- Added 1MB JSON size limit in CLI argument parser.
- Added `threading.Lock` for thread-safe probe cache.
- Centralized all timeout constants in `limits.py`.

### Changed

- Standardized tool count to **87 MCP tools** across all documentation and metadata files.
- Removed duplicate Hyperframes Integration section from README.
- Removed duplicate architecture entry from README.
- Documented `video_cleanup` tool in TOOLS.md.
- Updated test count in TESTING.md.
- Marked shipped v1.3.0 features as completed in ROADMAP.md.
- Updated server.json version to 1.3.1.

### Removed

- **Remotion integration completely removed.** All Remotion MCP tools, CLI commands, client methods, engine modules, and tests have been deleted. The project now uses Hyperframes (HTML-native, Apache 2.0) as its sole code-based video creation engine.
  - Deleted: `mcp_video/remotion_engine.py`, `mcp_video/remotion_models.py`, `mcp_video/server_tools_remotion.py`, `mcp_video/client/remotion.py`, `mcp_video/cli/handlers_remotion.py`, `mcp_video/cli/parser/remotion.py`, `tests/test_remotion_engine.py`, `tests/test_remotion_deprecation.py`
  - Removed `RemotionNotFoundError`, `RemotionProjectError`, `RemotionRenderError` from `errors.py`
  - Removed `VALID_REMOTION_TEMPLATES` from `validation.py`
  - Removed Remotion category from `doctor.py` checks
  - Updated `test_public_surface.py`: 87 MCP tools (was 93), 88 CLI commands (was 94)
  - Removed `remotion` optional dependency, pytest marker, and keyword from `pyproject.toml`
  - Removed Remotion CI smoke test job
  - Updated all documentation to remove Remotion references

### Design

- Redesigned landing page: Space Grotesk + DM Sans typography, orange/teal video-editing palette.
- Fixed broken mobile menu with proper responsive CSS.
- Added inline SVG favicon, ARIA labels, skip-to-content link.
- Improved hero headline: "87 Video Tools. Zero Cloud Costs."
- Added Organization schema markup for better SEO.
- Optimized font loading with preconnect hints.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-04-28

### Added

- **Crop by percentage** — `crop()` now accepts `crop_percent` (e.g. `crop_percent=50` for a center 50% crop). Alternative to explicit `width` + `height`.
- **Orientation-aware metadata** — `VideoInfo` now exposes `rotation`, `display_width`, `display_height`, and `display_resolution`. ffprobe `side_data_list` is parsed for rotation metadata.
- **Audio waveform text representation** — `WaveformResult.text` returns an ASCII art waveform for agent-friendly display.
- **Frame-accurate seeking** — `trim()` gains `accurate=True` for output-seeking (slower, frame-perfect) vs the default fast input-seeking.
- **Pipeline output cleanup** — `Client.pipeline()` gains `cleanup=True` to auto-remove intermediate files after chaining.
- **Structured logging** — New `--verbose` / `-v` CLI flag enables DEBUG logging to stderr.
- **Template preview** — `preview_template()` returns operations list + estimated output before rendering a timeline template.
- **Custom font upload** — `font_manager.py` downloads and caches Google Fonts by name for use in text overlays.
- **Usage analytics** — `analytics.py` sends an optional anonymous ping on server startup. Disable with `MCP_VIDEO_ANALYTICS=0`.
- **HLS/DASH streaming** — `hls_segment()` segments video into HTTP Live Streaming format with multi-quality variants.
- **Advanced codecs** — `convert()` now supports `hevc` (H.265), `av1`, and `prores` output formats.
- **Advanced masking** — New `luma_key()` (brightness-based masking) and `shape_mask()` (circle, rounded_rect, oval) tools.
- **Smarter GIF output** — Quality-based fps scaling (10/12/15/20), Bayer dithering, and 128-color palette generation.

### Changed

- **Merge auto-normalize** now handles fps mismatches, audio sample rate mismatches, and rotation-aware display dimensions during normalization.
- **Remotion deprecation upgraded** from `DeprecationWarning` to `FutureWarning` for v1.3.0 timeline.
- Public tool count updated from 90 to **87** unique MCP tools.

### Fixed

- `convert()` vs `export_video()` docstrings clarified to distinguish format changes from quality-tuned delivery.

## 1.2.6 - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- Bumped version to 1.2.6 (1.2.5 tag already existed).

## 1.2.5 - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Hyperframes integration** — 8 new MCP tools, Python client methods, and CLI commands for HTML-native video creation:
  - `hyperframes_init` — scaffold new projects (blank, warm-grain, swiss-grid templates)
  - `hyperframes_render` — render compositions to MP4/WebM/MOV
  - `hyperframes_still` — render single frames via snapshot
  - `hyperframes_compositions` — list compositions in a project
  - `hyperframes_preview` — launch live preview studio
  - `hyperframes_validate` — validate project structure and run lint
  - `hyperframes_add_block` — install blocks from the Hyperframes catalog
  - `hyperframes_to_mcpvideo` — render then post-process with mcp-video in one step
- Full test suite for Hyperframes engine: 54 unit + integration tests in `tests/test_hyperframes_engine.py`.
- `sample_hyperframes_project` pytest fixture.

### Changed

- **Remotion is deprecated.** All Remotion MCP tools, client methods, and CLI commands now emit `DeprecationWarning`. Remotion will be removed in a future major version. Migrate to Hyperframes (Apache 2.0) or Revideo (MIT).
- Public tool count updated from 82 to 90 unique MCP tools.
- `mcp_video/client/remotion.py` — all methods now warn on usage.

### Fixed

- `hyperframes_engine.validate()` no longer raises `HyperframesProjectError` when no HTML entry point is found; it correctly reports the issue in the validation result.

## 1.2.4 - 2026-04-22

### Added
- `Client.subtitles_styled()` alias for `text_subtitles()` to match MCP tool rename.
- Runnable `workflow.py` for `02-podcast-clip` (6 stages).

### Changed
- Documentation updated for `search_tools`, `workflows/`, and ICM alignment.
- `workflows/01-social-media-clip/workflow.py` fixed client arg names.

## 1.2.3 - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- Consolidated duplicate tools: removed `video_blur`, `video_color_grade`, and `video_extract_frame` as standalone tools. Functionality preserved through `video_filter` and `video_thumbnail`.
- Renamed `video_text_subtitles` to `video_subtitles_styled` for clearer naming.
- Added `search_tools` meta-tool for fast tool discovery by keyword.
- Updated public tool count from 83 to 81 unique tools.
- Reorganized docs/TOOLS.md into 12 functional categories.

### Fixed

- Image analysis tools (`image_extract_colors`, `image_generate_palette`, `image_analyze_product`) now accept video input by auto-extracting a representative frame.

### Added

- Added ICM-style `workflows/` directory with 3 production-ready pipelines: social-media-clip, podcast-clip, and explainer-video.
- Added `CLAUDE.md` and `workflows/CONTEXT.md` for agent context routing.

## 1.2.2 - 2026-04-21

### Added

- Added GitHub Discussions templates, CODEOWNERS, maintainer/governance docs, and Dependabot configuration.
- Added `llms.txt`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and `server.json` for search, AI-agent discovery, and MCP Registry readiness.
- Added `docs/AI_AGENT_DISCOVERY.md` and an adversarial remediation plan.
- Added `_validate_output_path()` and rolled it out across all engines for safer output directory handling.
- Added client-side validation and return type annotations for improved API contract consistency.
- Added current edge-case audit document (`docs/CURRENT_EDGE_CASE_AUDIT_2026-04-21.md`).
