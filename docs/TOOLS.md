# MCP Tools Reference

mcp-video exposes 119 registered MCP tools across video editing, PUSHING CREATION-style planning, Hyperframes video authoring, repurposing packages, audio, effects, analysis, and image workflows. All return structured JSON with `success`, `output_path`, and operation metadata. On failure, they return `{"success": false, "error": {...}}` with auto-fix suggestions. High-risk video/audio operations also run preflight guardrails that warn or fail early before FFmpeg can silently produce unusable output.

## Meta / Discovery (1 tool)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_tools` | Search all registered MCP tools by keyword. Returns matching tool names, descriptions, and required parameters. Use this when you need to find the right tool without loading the full registry into context. |

**Python Client:**
```python
from mcp_video import Client
editor = Client()
results = editor.search_tools("subtitle")
# Returns: {"success": True, "count": 3, "tools": [...]}
```

## Hyperframes — HTML-Native Video (18 tools)

Create videos programmatically using [Hyperframes](https://hyperframes.io/) — an HTML-native framework for video (Apache 2.0).

## Glitch Effects (12 tools)

CPU-based glitch effects run entirely through FFmpeg. GPU-accelerated effects (marked below) require Node.js, the `MCP_VIDEO_CRUSH_PATH` environment variable pointing to the [CRUSH](https://github.com/pushingsquares/crush) shader sources, and the `canvas` npm package — install it once with `npm install` inside `mcp_video/_crush_shader/`.
